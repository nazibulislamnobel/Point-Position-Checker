# Point-Position-Checker
Determine the position of a point relative to a line segment with this Python script. Input coordinates for three points (p0, p1, and p2), and the script calculates if p2 is on the same line, to the left, or to the right of the line formed by p0 and p1. Easily assess point positions and enhance your understanding of geometry.
